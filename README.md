<h1>Data-Swallow</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Data-Swallow is an abstract, asynchronous framework for pulling data from any data source and firing triggers in response. The data-sources you choose can be arbitrary and the triggers (actions to be taken in response) can do anything. 

At the most abstract level, the Data-Swallow is a signal-processing engine modeled off of the Microsoft Media Foundation framework (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms694197(v=vs.85).aspx). Data is generated by Data Sources, modified by Filters, and then sent to Sinks. Any number of Filters may be added in between the Data Source and the Sink and your Data Sources and Filters may multicast to as may other Filters as it wants. 

<h2>Not a Runtime</h2>
Data-Swallow is not a runtime environment. You cannot configure Data Sources, Filters, or Sinks. You must create them (read: program them) and compile the code. Several Data Sources are provided as a convenience, but the actual engine will not run by itself.
